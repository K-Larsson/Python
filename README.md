# Python!

### There will be folders and some organization soon

#### Please keep in mind that most of this isn't even remotely close to complete as I'm continuously working on multiple projects and therefore files are subject to change

Before making an example of my poor life choices naming files and variables, consider me a human being with emotions but if you'd be interested in messaging me go to [My Twitter](https://twitter.com/n0ssral "Click Me!")

- The different folders will act as containers for every project until I figure something better out
